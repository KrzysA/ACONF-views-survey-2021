I think we need to understand why they dont get much consideration until a family member becomes affected. Mental health is talked about more openly than it has been in the past but it is still difficult to access any meaningful treatment unless the condition becomes acute or life threatening. What are the main causes of loneliness how does it affect people and what can be done to avoid it. These are very important issues which I am sure are widespread but seem almost invisible unless you are caught up in them.  Perhaps if we gave  these matters more consideration at an early age as part of our education maybe some of the pitfalls could be avoided. I believe at times we have transitioned into a digital society where texting and social media has replaced the need for human contact and meaningful relationships. Is there trouble ahead?
